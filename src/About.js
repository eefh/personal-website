            <hr></hr>
            <p>Ten years before I was born the World Wide Web was unleashed. Since its inception, the internet has grown in unimaginable proportion, 
                arguably becoming mankind's most valuable tool. </p>
            <p>It requires no introduction, but just a reminder: anyone with a connection is essentially granted access
                to everything humanity has to offer. For the first time in human history, nearly everyone on Earth is able to take part in a global market.
                The deal goes both ways: anyone with a connection can access a breadth of information, as well as make their own creations accessible to others.
                In other words, you can view billions of images and videos, listen to music, read any book, play videogames, and visit countless websites 
                AND you can also make your own content and send it out to a network of billions of people.</p>
            <p>A universe of information, data, code. Information is arguably the first thing humans have ever "automated", in the form of written text.
                The internet thrives because of automation, without it, it simply wouldn't work! (Unless, of course, you happen to have an army of diligent 
                gnome workers sending files one bit at a time, one can dream.)</p>
